# Grocery Store Facade Design Pattern Example

This repository provides a simple demonstration of the Facade Design Pattern in the context of a grocery store application. The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified, high-level interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

 
## Description

In this example, we simulate the operations of a grocery store, which includes interactions with various subsystems. The Facade Design Pattern is applied to simplify the interactions and create a unified interface for customers.

## Getting Started

To get started with this example, make sure you have a development environment set up with a compatible programming language. You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
